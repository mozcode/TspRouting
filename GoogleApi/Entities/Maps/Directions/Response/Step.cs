A step is the most atomic unit of a direction's route, containing a single step describing a specific, single instruction on the journey. E.g.

For example, a step denoted as "Merge onto I-80 West" may contain a duration of "37 miles" and "40 minutes," indicating that the next step is 37 miles/40 minutes from this step.
